Bounty-Android-Notes
====================

Taking notes is something that we encounter everday at Artoo, whether it is our workplace or we are in the field resolving problems and taking feedbcaks. The idea of doing that on mobile devices efficiently has given rise to several notes applications like _evernote_ and _google keep_ and we hope the same from you.

We would like you to build a simple Notes application for android. User should be able to view all notes on a single screen (All Notes Screen) in a multicolumn view like this -

Also on adding a new note, the notes on All Notes Screen should rearranges themselves to show the latest notes on top. You can refer to [this video](http://artoogithubdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/bounty/keep2.gif) to understand how exactly you need to make notes transitions.
